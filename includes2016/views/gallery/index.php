THIS IS THE GALLERY PAGE

- Not quite sure how to pull it off -> Options :
    - 1. @massimo's gallery with infinite scroll and animations. Keeps loading as long as there are pictures.
    - 2. Make a 3D gallery where one could move around with touch controls or mouse.

1. Easy to implement but break GOT theme a bit.
2. Harder but interactive and whatnot.
